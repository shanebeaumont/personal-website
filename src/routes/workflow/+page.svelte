        <h1>Here's What I Use</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Everything I use has the aim of being efficient, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing for me with a focus on minimalism.</p>

    <h2>System</h2>

    <p>I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux"><strong>Arch Linux</strong></a>. Arch Linux is not a user&#8209;friendly distribution, but a user&#8209;centric one, prioritising functionality over ideology, and offering freedom, flexibility, and control. With its package management and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling-release</a> model, my software is always up-to-date without ever locking me out with an update screen or interupting my work with a forced reboot.</p>

    <p>For window management, <a href="/blog/i-love-tiling-window-managers">I love tiling window managers</a>. I like something hackable, so I use <a href="https://qtile.org"><strong>Qtile</strong></a>, as it has the features I love, and is easy to extend by adding my own functionality, since it's configured in Python. With a tiling window manager, I can manage windows entirely through keybindings and maximise the space of my screen quickly and effortlessly.</p>

    <p>I like to spend a lot of time in my terminal, so I use <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty"><strong>kitty</strong></a> because it's fast, feature-rich, and GPU based. For my interactive shell, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell"><strong>Zsh</strong></a> for it's quality of life features, and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dash"><strong>Dash</strong></a> as my non-interactive shell for it's speed.</p>

    <h2>Coding and Writing</h2>

    <p>My ideal IDE should be fast, configurable, and keyboard&#8209;centric, so <a href="https://neovim.io/"><strong>Neovim</strong></a> is the best choice. Because Neovim requires a lot of configuration to get everything working nicely together and plugins are updated very often, I use <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org">LazyVim</a> which I have my own personal configuration of.</p>

    <p><a href="https://vimwiki.github.io"><strong>VimWiki</strong></a> is a fantastic note taking plugin for vim that I can simply dropdown from my scratchpad in neovim, meaning taking notes can be done anytime effortlessly using a simple keybind.</p>

    <h2>Internet Browser</h2>

    <p>My browser is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new"><strong>Firefox</strong></a> with <a href="https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js">Arkenfox</a>, using personalised overrides, and my very own userChrome.css, <a href="https://github.com/shanebeaumont/purusfox">Purusfox</a>. The only must-have extension is <a href="https://ublockorigin.com">uBlock Origin</a>, which I use on <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-hard-mode">hard mode</a>.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>I set up my own <strong>Network&#8209;Attached Storage (NAS)</strong> on a <strong>Raspberry&nbsp;Pi</strong> to seamlessly work on my projects from any device. It also stores a Git repository for my dotfiles, with separate branches for each device, allowing me to clone a bare repository to manage all of my configurations with version control.</p>
