    <h2>I'm Shane</h2>

    <p>This is my own little home on the internet to write <a href="/blog">my blog</a> and to show off <a href="/projects">my projects</a>. If you'd like to learn a little bit <a href="/about">about me</a>, you can.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at <a href="mailto:shanebeaumont@protonmail.com">shanebeaumont@protonmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>What's Keeping me Busy</h2>

    <h3>Website Userstyles</h3>

    <p>I'm currently maintaining and updating my currently available userstyle for YouTube, while writing new userstyles for GitHub and DuckDuckGo.</p>

    <h3>Compact and Minimal Firefox UI</h3>

    <p>I'm currently developing my compact and minimal Firefox UI built for keyboard&#8209;centric users called Purusfox. <a href="https://github.com/shanebeaumont/purusfox">Check it out on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h3>2D Physics-Based Ball Game</h3>

    <p>I've recently begun developing a 2D physics-based game in using <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, where players control a ball and navigate the environment using momentum. <a href="https://github.com/shanebeaumont/ball-game">Check it out on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h3>Customisable YouTube Front-End</h3>

    <p>I’m considering developing a self-hosted, customizable YouTube front-end called PureTube, which will utilize the YouTube Data API. It’s not yet available on GitHub.</p>

    <h3>Blog</h3>

    <p>I’m also writing occasionally and have drafted a few ideas for new blog posts. Additionally, I plan to enhance my existing post, <a href="/blog/i-love-tiling-window-managers">I Love Tiling Window Managers</a>.</p>
